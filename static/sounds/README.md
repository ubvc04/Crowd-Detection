# Alarm Sound File

This folder should contain an alarm sound file named `alarm.mp3`.

Since we cannot generate actual audio files, you need to add your own alarm sound:

## How to add alarm sound:

1. Find or download an alarm sound file (MP3 format)
2. Rename it to `alarm.mp3`
3. Place it in this folder: `static/sounds/alarm.mp3`

## Alternative:
You can use any alert/siren/beep sound that you prefer. Just make sure it's named `alarm.mp3` and placed in this directory.

The system will automatically play this sound when more than 10 people are detected!
